> 1.  Is it possible to increase the MTU to more than 1450 when creating a network that will use the tenant vlan/vxlan?
openstack network create --share --project admin --internal dpdk-net1 -- MTU 1...???

Here is the deployment config you are looking for:

  TenantNetPhysnetMtu:
    type: number
    default: 1500
    description: |
        MTU of the underlying physical network. Neutron uses this value to
        calculate MTU for all virtual network components. For flat and VLAN
        networks, neutron uses this value without modification. For overlay
        networks such as VXLAN, neutron automatically subtracts the overlay
        protocol overhead from this value.
        (The mtu setting of the Tenant network in network_data.yaml
        control's this parameter.)


> 2.  I do not understand how RX queues applies.  This has nothing to do with mulitqueue, correct?  Does this correlate to PMD's?  Thank you

Yes, this would setup 4 receive queues for this dpdk interface or bond.  It would allow these rx queues to be spread across multiple PMDs if available.

Hope this helps.
